S3 Bash Scripts

In my quest to study for the solution's architect associate exam I engaged myself in learning bashscripting for s3

I learnt how to create the following scripts leverging documentation, and guidance from the youtuber Andrew Brown from Free code camp. 

This is what I did with the scripts, Enjoy!

delete-object
genfiles - This is the folder that stores created files       
list-bucket  
put-object
Evan - This is a single object - it's purpose is to be put by a script to S3           
delete-bucket  
deleteall-objects
